THE FIRST WEB4 STANDARD JS FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING, TESTING & DEPLOYING ONE-PAGE 3D APPS WITH BUILT-IN BLOCKCHAIN & AI API LIBRARIES FOR TEXT, IMAGE, AUDIO, VIDEO AND DOCUMENTS

# Welcome to kwami-cli

## THE COMMUNITY

### What we are

Besides the obvious, we are a javascript open source project for building next web generation applications with a common, complete, clean, and fast framework.

We are a community of free thinkers, mathematicians, physcisians, data scientists, software engineers, hackers, devops, designers (3D & 2D), traders, quants, coders, autodidacters, blockchain and AI developers and/or enthutiasts, and anyone in the world, who is curious, ambitious and willing to learn, grow and share in this fair digital organization.

We are an horizontal organization, all profits generated in kwami.io are distributed equally to all active members, distributed automatically by smart contracts. We do not bealive in democracy but meritocracy. We aim to build a more sustainable, equally and fair world for our children, and we will achieve thanks to technology.

We bealive in Web3, but we are building the Web4, the new World Wide Web (WWWW) with Blockchain and AI technology.

We aim to offer to the internet public a third option in the dual mononpoly of the apps markets, Apple Store and Google Play platforms. An open source repository for anyone to develop, build and deploy in one secure and updated ecosystem.

We bealive in free education, collaborative tutoring and equal opporunities for everyone.

We are an open source community, so your goal must be to participate and contribute actively. If we want to achieve global equallity we must think how to build the next generation of web4 apps, and we can leave it to Google, Meta, Amazon, etc. Or we can do it together sharing information and demostrating another way of collaborative economy. I know it sounds utopic, but everything is about information, so rights decisions must be taked together, because everyone, anyone of us has something to contribute.

All apps built by the community are licensed under the MIT License. All code deployed is public clients (frontend), servers (backend) and contracts (blockchain).

Everyone can participate in the creation of the metaverse. We are a group of developers building everyday, sharing ideas and helping anyone who is interested in participating (in one way or another).

### What we are not

Simple. We are not a big corporation trying to profit on users stilling their data. We are internet users, as our kids, friends and family, so as a developers we must protect them, no use them.

Internet revolution as 2023 has become

## Introduction

### So what the f\* is Web4?

Web4 is the natural evolution of Web3.

Web3 had its hype on 2020-2021 with the arrival of NFT marketplaces, like Opensea, however, it last until 2022 and make last adopters lost million of $ caused a clearly by a wrong

Web1 = read
Web2 = Web1 + write
Web3 = Web2 + Blockchain
Web4 = Web3 + { AI + 3D + Voice }

Kwami is the first easy-to-use framework to make building Web4 APPs (web & mobile) from a single javascript framework easy and fast as any otherframework. It's based on a modular architecture with individual Node & Python containers

As a developer comming from low-level languages, like C or C++, and mainly focus my carrier on data science building financial trading systems, during over 8 years of my life. Also I'm a passionate of hardware for long time, so my mind is well trained on data structure and system architecure. However, javascript has being the most painly stack I have ever learn, but on 2020 I was decided to stop my career as quant and start helping to build the next generation of decentralized apps, the opportunities was great, rebuild the existing web with blockchain transactions, easy, I thought, and I new the shorter way was through javascript. And I suffered, the way is some ambigious sometimes, broke my ming. Then I discovered Typescript and I just loved it! It the same shit actually, it compiles (build) to javascript again, actually is not even a language, it's just a javascript developing (no runtime) framework that allows you to type your code and to create data typed interfaces, nothing special. I have built many apps since then with TS, however, I decided to build this framework in vanilla ES6 JavaScript. I know! But look, it was

, has been the most hard languga

## Steps to become a full-stack Web4 Engineer with Kwami

Firstable, you must know that if you already know some frontend or backend development you must know that will take you only 2-1 month to become a kami developer, as all needed tools and APIs are already built-in in the kwami-cli.

On the other hand, if you are new to coding but you want to become a web4 full-stack developer, thanks to bootcamp.kwami.io your learning curve will be very fast, as our 8 week bootcamp will teach everything you need know in coding, web1, web3 and web3 development, and your learn how to build, test and automatically deploying Web3 for apps, with AI tools, Blockchain transactions, and much more with a single, easy-to-learn and complete development framework for juniors and seniors. Open source and free automatic easy deployment.
