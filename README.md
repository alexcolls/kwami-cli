Welcome to kwami.io

We are a community of mathematicians, physcisians, software engineers, data scientists, hackers, devops, designers, coders, autodidacts, free thinkers, blockchain and AI enthutiasts, and anyone curious who is willing to learn.

We are an horizontal organization, all blockchain profits are distributed equally to all active members, distributed automatically by smart contracts.

We bealive in Web3, but we have built Web4, the new World Wide Web (WWWW) with blockchain and AI technology.

All apps built by the community are licensed under the MIT License. All code deployed is public clients (frontend), servers (backend) and contracts (blockchain).

We aim to offer to the internet public a third option in the dual mononpoly of the apps markets, Apple Store and Google Play platforms.

Everyone can participate in the creation of the Metaverse. We are a group of developers building everyday, sharing ideas and helping anyone who is interested in participate (in one way or another)

More coming soon...
