# kwami.io

We are a community of free thinkers, mathematicians, physcisians, data scientists, software engineers, hackers, devops, designers (3D & 2D), traders, quants, coders, autodidacts, free thinkers, blockchain and AI enthutiasts, and anyone curious who is willing to learn, grow and share.

We are an horizontal organization, all profits generated in kwami.io are distributed equally to all active members, distributed automatically by smart contracts.

We do not bealive in democracy but meritocracy. We aim to build a more sustainable, equally and fair world for our children, and we will achieve thanks to technology.

We bealive in Web3, but we have built Web4, the new World Wide Web (WWWW) with blockchain and AI technology.

We are an open source community, so your goal must be to participate and contribute actively. If we want to achieve global equallity we must think how to build the next generation of web4 apps, and we can leave it to Google, Meta, Amazon, etc. Or we can do it together sharing information and demostrating another way of collaborative economy. I know it sounds utopic, but everything is about information, so rights decisions must be taked together, because everyone, anyone of us has something to contribute.

All apps built by the community are licensed under the MIT License. All code deployed is public clients (frontend), servers (backend) and contracts (blockchain).

We aim to offer to the internet public a third option in the dual mononpoly of the apps markets, Apple Store and Google Play platforms. An open source repository for anyone to develop, build and deploy in one secure and updated ecosystem.

We bealive in free education, collaborative tutoring and equal opporunities for everyone.

Everyone can participate in the creation of the metaverse. We are a group of developers building everyday, sharing ideas and helping anyone who is interested in participate (in one way or another).
